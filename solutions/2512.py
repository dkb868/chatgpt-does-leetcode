"""solve in python3, just give a code block.

You are given two string arrays positive_feedback and negative_feedback, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that no word is both positive and negative.

Initially every student has 0 points. Each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by 3, whereas each negative word decreases the points by 1.

You are given n feedback reports, represented by a 0-indexed string array report and a 0-indexed integer array student_id, where student_id[i] represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report report[i]. The ID of each student is unique.

Given an integer k, return the top k students after ranking them in non-increasing order by their points. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.

 

Example 1:

Input: positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: 
Both the students have 1 positive feedback and 3 points but since student 1 has a lower ID he ranks higher.
Example 2:

Input: positive_feedback = ["smart","brilliant","studious"], negative_feedback = ["not"], report = ["this student is not studious","the student is smart"], student_id = [1,2], k = 2
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: 
- The student with ID 1 has 1 positive feedback and 1 negative feedback, so he has 3-1=2 points. 
- The student with ID 2 has 1 positive feedback, so he has 3 points. 
Since student 2 has more points, [2,1] is returned.
