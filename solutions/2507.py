"""solve in python3, just return code block.

You are given a positive integer n.

Continuously replace n with the sum of its prime factors.

Note that if a prime factor divides n multiple times, it should be included in the sum as many times as it divides n.
Return the smallest value n will take on.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 15
Output: 5
Explanation: Initially, n = 15.
15 = 3 * 5, so replace n with 3 + 5 = 8.
8 = 2 * 2 * 2, so replace n with 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
6 = 2 * 3, so replace n with 2 + 3 = 5.
5 is the smallest value n will take on.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, n = 3.
3 is the smallest value n will take on.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 10^5
